            Hi! I’m Ahmed Basuoney, and I’m a developer who has passion for building clean web applications with intuitive
            functionalities. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into reality using creative solutions. I’m always
            curious about
            learning new skills, tools, and concepts. In addition to working on various solo full stack projects, I have
            worked with
            creative teams, which involves daily stand-ups and communications, source control, and project management.
